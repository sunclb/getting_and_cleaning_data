# Code Book
This code book describes the output data obtained in the data file `tidy.txt`.
Tidy data file contains the mean and standard deviation measurements for each activity and test subject.
There are 35 observations and 20 variables.

## Descriptive Variables

* `activity` - a character vector with activity name for each observation
* `subject`  - a numeric vector to identify test subject for each observation


## Measurement Variables
The following measurement variables are represented as the average value for each activity and each test subject.

* `Time.BodyAccMag.mean`          
* `Time.BodyAccMag.std`         
* `Time.GravityAccMag.mean`
* `Time.GravityAccMag.std`
* `Time.BodyAccJerkMag.mean`
* `Time.BodyAccJerkMag.std`
* `Time.BodyGyroMag.mean`
* `Time.BodyGyroMag.std`
* `Time.BodyGyroJerkMag.mean`
* `Time.BodyGyroJerkMag.std`
* `Freq.BodyAccMag.mean`
* `Freq.BodyAccMag.std`
* `Freq.BodyBodyAccJerkMag.mean`
* `Freq.BodyBodyAccJerkMag.std`
* `Freq.BodyBodyGyroMag.mean`
* `Freq.BodyBodyGyroMag.std`
* `Freq.BodyBodyGyroJerkMag.mean`
